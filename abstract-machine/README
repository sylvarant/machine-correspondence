# Secure CESK Machine Implementation

# Compilation
#=============================

$ make exec :: for mac / linux
$ make one; cd Secure; make; cd ..; make output :: for fides, requires working fides toolchain install
$ make spmproto.elf  :: for sancus, requires working sancus toolchain install

# Details
#=============================

This is a Fides/sancus enabled implementation of the CESK machine that results from the syntactic correspondence.
Given that malloc and free where not available during most of our tests on Sancus,
that part of the implementation still focusses on a simple static memory buffer which is only flushed at the end.
Using this for anything more than a prototype will require adding the necessary free's.

The PMA: the entrypoints are defined in:
    * PMA.h

The secure cesk for MiniML consists of the files :
    * Secure/cesk.h
    * Secure/cesk.c

The attacker resides in : 
    * main.c
