This is a Sancus enabled implementation of the result of the functional correspondence.
Given that malloc and free where not available during most of our tests on Sancus,
the implementation still focusses on a simple static memory buffer which is only flushed at the end.
Using this for anything more than a prototype will require adding the necessary free's.

The secure cek for MiniML consists of the files :
    * securecek.h
    * securecek.c
At compile time these files are converted into a protected module of the PMA mechanism referred to as SPM.
The secure side features doubles of the functionality to create terms in the common language (FFI) to minimize
call backs, as well as to reduce the requirements on the insecure side.

The FFI: its common language and know entrypoints are defined in :
    * commonlanguage.h
    * FFI.h

The unkown context is a CEK implementation of MiniML_a
This could in a sense be any C program but we chose a CEK to easily debug the behaviour of the secure cek
it consists of the files :
    * environment.h
    * environment.c
    * insecurecesk.c
    * main.c
